Display weather forecase on neopixels in a frame

Adopted from https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-Weather-Display-With-ESP8266

This runs on a wemos D1_mini, Nodemcu or compatible ESP8266 board. By default the
board is configured to connect to a strip of 4 WS2812 LEDs but the number can
be adjusted in the source. The strip is split into two equal segments to display
a two color pattern for the upcoming weather condition.
